* When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with: the city name; the date; an icon representation of weather conditions; the temperature; the humidity; the wind speed; 
* When a user views future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays: the date; an icon representation of weather conditions; the temperature; the humidity
* When a user clicks on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
